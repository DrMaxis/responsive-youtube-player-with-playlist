=======================================

**(RYPP)** Responsive YouTube Player with Playlist, title is self-explanatory ;-)

## Requirements

`Jquery (1.9.1+)`
`RYPP.js`
`RYPP.css`

## IMPORTANT UPDATE: Youtube V.3 API KEY

Since last Youtube API, it's mandatory to create a YT API Key in order to get the Playlist contents... there aren't other ways to bypass to do this. The old XML Feed used in the V.01 of RYPP has been removed by Youtube.

In order to create your own API Key follow these intructions:
<https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started>

## TO-DO / Known issues

1. By default playlist JSON response its limited to 50 items, so you cannot retrieve more than 50 items froma playlist.

2. At this moment **RYPP** supports one instance per page, that means you cannot add several **RYPP** players in the same page... sorry for the inconvenience.

3. Testing in IE. Right now its only tested in Chrome. Any bug report will b great apretiated.

## Usage

Basic `HTML` element:

````html
<div class="RYPP r4-3" data-playlist="PL2591DC20C4BB4D78">
  <div id="RYPP-video">
    <div id="RYPP-video-player">
      <!-- Will be replaced -->
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="RYPP-playlist">
    <header>
      <h2 class="_h1">Playlist title</h2>
      <p>Playlist subtitle<a href="#" target="_blank">#hashtag</a></p>
    </header>
    <div class="RYPP-items"></div>
  </div>
</div>
````

Starting `RYPP` from JS:

````javascript
$(document).ready(function() {

  \\ Before initilize RYPP you need to set your API Key
  \\ In the creation process you can define in wich websites
  \\ can be used, to avoid unnapropiated uses
  RYPP.api_key = 'AIzaSyA1rpTMrNjth1R6-LfLe0UG8v1946nj3Xw';

  \\ Initialize the player
  $('.RYPP').rypp();
});
````

## Settings

Aspect ratio of the YouTube video id set adding an additional class to the `<div class="RYPP r4-3" data-playlist="PL2591DC20C4BB4D78">` container, you can use `r2-1`, `r4-3` and `r16-9` (default). Be free to define your own in the RYPP.scss stylesheet.


`data-playlist="PL2591DC20C4BB4D78"`
ID of the YouTube playlist, RYPP will automatically get its data and thumbnails and populate the list on the right with them. Take a look to `demo-playlist.htm`.

`data-ids="hWGUnrIiOoI,7nXcLBXR70M"`
Alternativelly to the playlist you can provide a lista of **comma-separated ids** of the YouTube v√≠deos you want to add to the playlist. Take a look to `demo-id-list.htm`.

## Manual / 'hardcoded' (TO-DO!!!)

You can also _prefill_ the playlist with some _harcoded_ videos and ignore the playlists / id-list functionallity... take a look to `demo-hardcoded.htm`.
